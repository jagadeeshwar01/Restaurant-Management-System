# Restaurant-Management-System
Introduction:
The project restaurant management system is all about making
the process of billing of the items ordered by the customers
easier.This system can be used by the restaurant employees, so
that they can make all the billing calculations without effort, can
keep record of orders that opted for home delivery and also to
keep record of the items present in the restaurant.
Why we need to develop restaurant management
system?
Today, all services are available online and the time factor along
with accuracy is the most important thing to be considered in any
of the stream. So, we need a restaurant management system to
make the restaurant services online and efficient anad available
to most people.
How it works?
In general, whenever billing is done, employee use paper pen to
calculate the bill manually. This takes a lot of math to be done.
And now a days the restaurants also need to apply taxes of about
5 – 10% on each order. So, calculating along with keeping track
orders and adding this to every bill will be a problem.
“Therefore, to overcome these problems, we made a restaurant
management system.”
To make this project we used the java swing
In order to implement this project, I used swing. Java swing was
introduced in 1997. It is built on the foundation of the AWT.
It has two key features:
1. Light weight component: swing components are written
entirely in java and do not map directly to platform specific peers.
2. A pluggable look and feel – each swing component are
rendered by java code rather by native peers the look and feel of
component is under control of swing.
I. Swing provides more powerful and flexible GUI component
than does the AWT.
II. AWT is heavyweight whereas swing is lightweight.
III. The look and feel of each component if AWT were fixed, it
cannot be changed.
IV. The use of heavy weight causes no flexibility So I preferred
swing. I used the following swing component in the project I
developed.
1.JFrame: It is an extended version of java.awtframe that adds
support for the swing component architecture.
2.JPanel: The JPanel is a simplest container class. It provides
space in which an application can attach any other
component. It inherits the JComponents class.
3.JTabbedPane: The JTabbedPane class is used to switch
between a group of components by clicking on a tab with a
given title or icon. It inherits JComponent class.
4.JButton: It is an implementation of push button.
5.JLabel: It is a display area for a short text string or an image
or both.
6.JTextfeild: It is a light weight component which allows the
editing of a single line or text.
7.JOptionpane: It makes it easy to pop up a standard dialog box
that prompts users for a value or informs them of something.
Uses:
• It is used to reduce errors in calculation of bill. It increases the
efficiency of the order taking and billing system of the
restaurant.
• Very important to manage rush of customers at the billing
counter.
• Customers themselves can use this management system, as
they can see the all the items present in the restaurant, and
order dishes of their wish and generate bill by themselves
and then pay it, with some restriction.
